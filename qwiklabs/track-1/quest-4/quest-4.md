# Perform Foundational Infrastructure Tasks in Google Cloud

_Note: It is highly recommended that you __try__ to complete the objectives either twice or thrice before visiting the solutions._


## Task 1: Create the production environment

The first step is to create a production environment.
- In the GCP Console go to Navigation Menu >Compute Engine > VM Instance.
- Click the SSH button to access the jumphost instance.
- In the SSH window, go to the cd /work/dm directory.
- Use an editor to open the configuration file prod-network.yaml, and replace SET_REGION to us-east1

__Note: All commands are to be written in SSH of VM instance.__

```
nano prod-network.yaml
```
After making changes press ```Ctrl+x``` -> ```y``` -> ```Enter```
- Copy and Paste the following command.
```
sed -i s/SET_REGION/us-east1/g prod-network.yaml
```
```
gcloud deployment-manager deployments create prod-network --`config=prod-network.yaml
```
- Now create a Kubernetes cluster in the new network.
```
gcloud config set compute/zone us-east1-b

gcloud container clusters create kraken-prod \
          --num-nodes 2 \
          --network kraken-prod-vpc \
          --subnetwork kraken-prod-subnet
```

- Checking Credentials of kraken-pod
```
gcloud container clusters get-credentials kraken-prod
```

- Go to Directory
```
cd /work/k8s
for F in $(ls *.yaml); do kubectl create -f $F; done
```


## Task 2: Setup the Admin instance
In this step Create kraken-admin and Monitoring workspace.
- Create kraken-admin through this command :
```
gcloud config set compute/zone us-east1-b
gcloud compute instances create kraken-admin --network-interface="subnet=kraken-mgmt-subnet" --network-interface="subnet=kraken-prod-subnet"
```

- Create a Monitoring workspace

In the GCP Console go to Navigation Menu > Monitoring> Alerting.

- Click Create Policy.
 Click Add Condition, and then set up the Metrics with the following parameters:
    - Fields- Options
    - Resource Type- GCE VM Instance
    - Metric- CPU Utilization compute.googleapis.com/instance/cpu/utilization
    - Filter- Choose instance id and paste the value copied from kraken-admin
    - Threshold- 0.5 for 1 minute
- Click ADD and add an email in the Notification setting.

## Step 3: Verify the Spinnaker deployment

In this step the lab manual suggests you use Cloud Shell and kubectl to port forward the spin-deck pod from port 9000 to 8080.

- In the GCP Console go to Navigation Menu >Kubernetes Engine > Services & Ingress
- Go to spin-deck.
- Click Port Forward.
- Cloud Shell will open with the port forwarding command.
- Click on the web preview icon on cloud shell open port 8080.

- Clone your source code repository and commit it by following the command.
_Note: Commands written in cloud Shell._

```
gcloud config set compute/zone us-east1-b

gcloud source repos clone sample-app
```
```
cd sample-app

touch a
```
```
git config --global user.email "$(gcloud config get-value account)"

git config --global user.name "Student"

git commit -a -m "change"

git tag v1.0.1

git push --tags
```

Congratulations! You have completed your lab successfully.
